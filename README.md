# Hint for your exams 

#Don't forget to read the information on notion before the exam date <br/>
1-Exam login details at the login screen- username: exam, password: exam <br/>
2-open terminal and type examshell to start the exam <br />
3-Also open your Visual Studio code. <br/>
4-When you encounter challenges, be patient and try to trace the solution. <br/>
Note: You  can open the root from your terminal by typing <open..> to access the questions in an easier way and the repository. <br/>
Note: You won't get much help from the wolfpack when you run into trouble in the exams, so try to figure things out before the exams. It would also be helpful to gather relevant information from experienced students on campus. 

#During the exam <br />
1-Always remove comments and keep the norm. <br />
2-REmenber to push your code to rendu before typing grade me. <br />
3-Read through all of the subjects and examples again before final submission <br />
